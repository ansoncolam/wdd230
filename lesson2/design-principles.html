            <p>White space and clean design gives enough spaces between elements by reducing excessive amount of texts and function elements that users can see in one screen. It enhances user comprehension and also improve attention drawing. Apple homepage does a good job on reserving enough spaces between elements and also allowing users see appropriate amount of information at once. The homepage looks clean and simple.</p>

            <p>Hick's Law states that a person takes more time to make a decision when more possible choices are availabe. Therefore, a website designer's goal is to make the website options clear and simple, in order to reduce the time which users take to access the website. Pizza Box homepage design helps to achieve this purpose. Instead of listed out all the options at once, the homepage is categorize into four main functions; so that users can navigate easily and reduce the decision-making time.</p>

            <p>Fitt's Law states that the time it takes for a person to move a pointer to a target area related to the size of the target and distance between the pointer and the target. FORTRESS page keeps the sizes of the icons big and the distance between targets are closed to the thumb's area.
